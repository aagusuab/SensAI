The Processtest.py tests the Process file in the NLP directory.
The Process.py has 3 functions:
getTag
- This function takes in a text sentence, and returns the list of part of speech tags
for each sentences.
getWord
- This function returns the given sentence in a list form.
getLength
- This function returns the length of a given text.

The final_outputtest tests the final_output.py in the NeuralNet directory.
The first test in the testfile is the code from evaluateNN.py (line 47 to 60)
This part tests whether the category number leads to the right function or not.
The next part tests the final_output.py, which translates the sentence into code.
(Rule based).
