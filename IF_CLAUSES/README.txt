1. First look at "out_script_sample" to get an idea of what type of sentences are represented (400 sentences, 2 variables)

2. The "out_script" is to train the NN (200.000 sentences, 20 different variables)

3. python condition_automized.py will reproduce the list for you. YOU have to delete the content in "out_script" first and than call the function. Otherwise it will just add the results onto the existing txt-file

Comment about the data:
-All sentences are represented twice. Condition and (Condition) in Parantheses
