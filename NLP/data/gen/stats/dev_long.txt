I recently momentarily opened my patio's door. The slimy bugs quietly entered
my apartment. I did not initially notice that the slimy bugs quietly entered my
apartment. I peacefully slept. I overnight awoke. I shockingly saw the slimy
bugs was on my apartment's ceiling. I grabbed the reachable thing because the
bugs scared me. The slimy bugs were my enemy. I smeared the greasy bugs's
innards. I managed to kill every bug. I grazed the bugs's leader with the rolled
comic book. I removed the tiny bugs's leader's limb. I angrily hit the bugs with
the rolled comic book. The big bugs's leader now lurked in my apartment. The
bugs's leader was the three-legged insect. The big bugs's leader escaped me. The
big bugs's leader undoubtedly wanted to retaliate against me. I looked around
every corner of my apartment. I checked my toilet seat for the big bugs's leader
in order for me to sit down on my toilet seat. I in due course expected for the
big bugs's leader to jump toward me. The cicadas did not even yet arrive to my
apartment. Every action of my story notably happened.
